# MOD-PROJECT-WISE-GAME
We originally had done the first function (initializeGame) together, and then we had split up the rest of the functions between the 3 of us.
Promesse worked on and completed the checkWinner and the Open and Close function
Angie had cellClicked function and the updateCell function
Nirobia had the checkwinner and the resetFunction function

The rest of the HTML, CSS, and Javascript was worked on together by the 3 of us.
